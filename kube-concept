## kubernetes objects ##

* Object Spec and Status
  every kubernetes object includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration
  the spec, which you must provide, describes your desired state for the objectâ€“the characteristics that you want the object to have.
  the status describes the actual state of the object, and is supplied and updated by the Kubernetes system.
